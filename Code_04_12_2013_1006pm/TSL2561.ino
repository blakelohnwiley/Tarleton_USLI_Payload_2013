 connect VDD to 3.3V DC
 connect GROUND to common ground
 ADDR can be connected to ground, or vdd or left floating to change the i2c address

 The address will be different depending on whether you let
 the ADDR pin float (addr 0x39), or tie it to ground or vcc. In those cases
 use TSL2561_ADDR_LOW (0x29) or TSL2561_ADDR_HIGH (0x49) respectively
